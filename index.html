            <p>Although not a complete build, the update to my personal computer was substantial enough to list as it
                consisited of an entirely new GPU, Motherboard, RAM and 4tb of SATA SSD/NVMe storage. The
                performance uplift I saw in games were massive, mostly due to the GPU upgrade, but the replacement of
                my old HDD's helped with responsiveness and 1% lows. The motherboard upgrade was mostly so I could
                switch
                from a Daisy Chain RAM topology to a <br>T-topology to give me more leeway when increasing my RAM
                timings.

            <p>Although it is the build that has given me the most issues, it gave me the oppertunity to work with parts
                I wouldn't have used myself but have wanted to build with purely for aesthetic reasons. The terrible MSI
                RGB fans with 3 cables also helped me better my cable management as it was a challenge to wire them all
                up.</p>
